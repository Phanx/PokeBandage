Description
--------------

Adds a button to the pet journal for using Battle Pet Bandages. The new
button is located directly to the left of the existing Revive Battle Pets
button, and looks and acts much the same. There are no options.


Feedback
-----------

Post a comment on the WoWInterface download page.

If you are reporting a bug, please include detailed instructions I can
follow to reproduce the bug myself, whether or not it still happens
when all other addons are disabled, and the exact text of the first
related error message (if any) from BugSack.

Please do not contact me by email about addon bugs, suggestions, or
questions, nor about general addon programming questions -- post a
comment or forum thread instead!
